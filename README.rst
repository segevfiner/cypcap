cypcap
======
This package is a Cython based binding for modern libpcap versions, attempting to be more complete
than existing and poorly maintained implementations.

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install cypcap

Python 3.6+ and libpcap 1.8+ is required (Older libpcap versions can be supported if needed).
